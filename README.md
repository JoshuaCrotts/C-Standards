C - Standards is the continuation of the Standards game library, originally written in Java. While not all features are implemented such as handlers, the basic necessities for creating a game are completely here. All data structures for entity-handling/updating/drawing should be drawn by the programmer, but these structures should come at a future date. SDL is the back-end graphical library for this engine.

## Dependencies

The only dependencies for this library are SDL components.

1. [SDL_2.0.12](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
