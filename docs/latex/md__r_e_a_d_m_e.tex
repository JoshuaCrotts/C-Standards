C -\/ Standards is the continuation of the Standards game library, originally written in Java. While not all features are implemented such as handlers, the basic necessities for creating a game are completely here. All data structures for entity-\/handling/updating/drawing should be drawn by the programmer, but these structures should come at a future date. S\+DL is the back-\/end graphical library for this engine.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsection{Dependencies}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}
The only dependencies for this library are S\+DL components.

{\bfseries{Windows}}\+: To rebuild the code, clone the repository to your computer. This project is compiled with Min\+GW and a makefile. Depending on how you want to compile the project (e.\+g. with Visual Studio, Code\+Blocks, etc.), you may need to alter the makefile to suit your needs. Downloading and installing the dependencies on Windows takes a little more effort than Mac\+OS or Linux\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download \href{https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/}{\texttt{ mingw-\/get-\/setup.\+exe}}.
\item Install all packages except mingw32-\/gcc-\/ada-\/base, mingw32-\/gcc-\/fortran-\/base, and mingw32-\/gcc-\/objc-\/base through the installer.
\item Download the four libraries above. The S\+D\+L2.\+0.\+12 link only provides a D\+LL file. The rest come in a .tar.\+gz file to extract. Make sure to choose the Min\+GW developer version.
\item Inside these archives exists two folders\+: an i686-\/w64, and x86\+\_\+64-\/w64 version. Choose the former (i686-\/w64). This is the 32-\/bit version, which is what we will use.
\item There are three folders in each extension\+: bin, include, and lib. The bin/ folder provides the .dll files. Store these in C\+:/\+Min\+G\+W/bin. The include/ folder has an S\+D\+L2 folder with the respective .h file. Drag the S\+D\+L2 folder into C\+:/\+Min\+G\+W/include (do not take the .h file out!). Lastly, the lib/ folder contains necessary libraries (.a files) that accompany the addon. Drag these into C\+:/\+Min\+G\+W/lib.
\item At this point, your code should be good to go. If you are using V\+S\+Code, make sure to set the compiler to gcc-\/x86, and set the compiler path to C\+:/\+Min\+G\+W/bin/gcc.exe. Compile the code via mingw32-\/make.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\bfseries{Mac\+OS}}\+: For Mac\+OS, run the following commands in your terminal to get the appropriate development files for S\+DL\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily brew install S\+D\+L2}
\item {\ttfamily brew install S\+D\+L2\+\_\+image}
\item {\ttfamily brew install S\+D\+L2\+\_\+ttf}
\item {\ttfamily brew install S\+D\+L2\+\_\+mixer}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Then, compile via {\ttfamily make}.

{\bfseries{Linux (Ubuntu/\+Debian)}}\+: The process is similar to the former, with the exception of having to install S\+DL files to your system in Linux. Run the following commands (or their distro-\/equivalent) in your terminal\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libsdl2-\/dev}
\item {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libsdl2-\/image-\/dev}
\item {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libsdl2-\/ttf-\/dev}
\item {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install libsdl2-\/mixer-\/dev}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Then, compile via {\ttfamily make}.

{\bfseries{Linux (Arch-\/\+Based Distros)}}\+: Run the following commands after cloning the repo to install S\+D\+L2\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily sudo pacman -\/S sdl2}
\item {\ttfamily sudo pacman -\/S sdl2\+\_\+image}
\item {\ttfamily sudo pacman -\/S sdl2\+\_\+ttf}
\item {\ttfamily sudo pacman -\/S sdl2\+\_\+mixer}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Then, compile via {\ttfamily make}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Reporting Bugs}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}

The {\bfseries{master}} branch encompasses all changes. The {\bfseries{development}} branches have in-\/progress additions and updates that are not yet ready for the master branch. Each person on the project has a respective development branch with their name as the suffix. Please work on only your branch. Additionally, if you are not on the immediate team, you can create a fork of the project, then submit a pull request for review.
